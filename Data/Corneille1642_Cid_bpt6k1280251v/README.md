``alto4eScriptorium`` contains all the ALTO (version 4) xml files which are the output files of [eScriptorium](http://traces6.paris.inria.fr/). Those files were cleaned and prepared thanks to [appenzeller segmentation model](https://github.com/Heresta/OCR17plus/tree/main/Model/Segment). This model is based on SegmOnto and its vocabulary ([link to the zones' denomination list](https://github.com/SegmOnto/examples/tree/main/zones) & [link to the lines' denomination list](https://github.com/SegmOnto/examples/tree/main/lines)).
